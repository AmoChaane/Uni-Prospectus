# Uni-Prospectus
All SA university courses and matric results requirements api


### How to add data

- If the file for the uni you want to add e.g `uj.json` you need to add it. 

- Then copy the schema from the `schema.json` file into your file and add data accordingly.

- All data for a particular uni should be appended in the file for that uni e.g all data related to `UJ` should be added into `uj.json`


### TO-DO

1. Find a university prospectus and copy all the necessary data into the schema

2. Build a JS script to test the searching and filtering algorithms against the schema

3. Create a server for the api

4. Run tests against the whole api
